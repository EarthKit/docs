Earthkit provides a natural language interface for querying [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/).

- Use natural langauge to describe your overpass turbo queries
- To mention specific locations, use the `@` symbol followed by the location name. For example, `@San Francisco`.
- To mention specific tags, use the `#` symbol followed by the tag name. For example, `#cafe`.
