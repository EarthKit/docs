title: Usage and Credits
---

EarthKit Agent is still in beta. 
We're still figuring out the best way to support/finance the operation of the service.
Meanwhile, our usage model is as follows:
- Each user gets 500 credits on signup.
- Each geolocation or verification task consumes 15 credits.
- If using a custom LLM provider(we currently support openrouter and openai), each task consumes 1 unit.
